ECE-4784-Modeling-Project-Phase-1
=================================

The first phase of the modeling project for ECE 4784 Fall 2014. Includes model representing the Hodgkin Huxley Model.

The simulation was created in MATLAB R2011a Student Edition. The code can be run by simply copying or cloning the GitHub repository into your MATLAB workspace and running the simulation with the following function:

<b>hhModel(impulseTime, amp), where impulseTime is the time in ms to provide the step pulse and amp is the amplitude of this pulse in micro-Amps</b>

For example, to run the simulation for part 2 of the assignment where there is a 0.5 ms, 5 micro-amp step pulse as an input, simply type “hhModel(0.5, 5)”.
